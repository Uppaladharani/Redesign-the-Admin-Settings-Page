**### Design Choices for Admin Settings Tasks**

In this project, my primary focus was to enhance the usability of the admin settings interface while staying true to the design and functionality of the original Recruit CRM settings page. Below, I outline the key changes made, the rationale behind them, and their impact on the user experience.

**One significant addition was a search bar, enabling users to quickly find specific settings by name.**
This change optimizes workflow efficiency by eliminating the need to scroll through extensive lists.
By introducing this feature, I aimed to make the interface more user-friendly and reduce the time required to locate the required setting.

**Another design priority was to closely replicate the visual and interactive elements of the original Recruit CRM admin settings page.**
This involved maintaining consistency in color schemes, typography, and spacing, ensuring that users familiar with the original interface would find this version intuitive and seamless.
By preserving these design standards, the system achieves both functionality and a polished, professional look.

**I also emphasized responsiveness and clarity by refining the layout.**
Icons were replaced with easily understandable images, enhancing accessibility for users who prefer visual cues. 
Hover interactions were added to provide descriptive labels, further improving navigation and reducing ambiguity.
